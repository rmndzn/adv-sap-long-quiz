## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
    - Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages. Developers use SOA to reuse services in different systems or combine several independent services to perform complex tasks.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
    - Scalability, Ease of Maintenance and Diversity are the benefits of using Microservices. Scability means in Microservices that the service that you give to the user is easy to handle without error or crash. Ease of Maintenance means that Microservices can maintain itself by updating regularly. Diversity means that microservices can be use in different technology that people are suitable to it.
3. Define Microservices.
    - The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably - a necessity for competing and winning in todayâ€™s world.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
    - Scalability, Ease of Maintenance and Diversity are the benefits of using Microservices. Scability means in Microservices that the service that you give to the user is easy to handle without error or crash. Ease of Maintenance means that Microservices can maintain itself technology that people are suitable to it.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
    - Similarities Both SOA and Microservices have scalability, Flexibility, and Scalability. Differences Autonomy is the differences of SOA and Microservices because Microservices are used to be highly autonomous while SOA is less.
6. Define Web Services.
    - A web service is a software system that supports interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format
7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
    - Reusability, Compability and Easy Integration. User can reuse parts of their work in different projects using web services.  Web services can work together, even if they're on different computers or use different software and Web services can easily be added to existing software. It's like adding a new feature to your phone without having to replace the whole thing.
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
    - XML Based, Loosely Coupled, and Coarse-Gained. Web services use XML for handling data. XML helps them work on different types of computers and systems, making them highly compatible across the board. Also In web services, the connection between a service and the user is flexible. the client can still use it without much trouble and Instead of offering small, specific tasks like some other technologies, web services give you bigger, more significant capabilities all at once. 
9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
    - Provider, Requestor, and Broker. The provider is the one who creates a web service and shares it with applications that want to use it. The requestor is application that needs to connect to a web service. The broker helps other apps find and get info from UDDI, making it simpler for them to find and use the web services they need.
10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
    - SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. SOAP is like a set of rules that they follow when passing 	messages WSDLtells you what a web service can do, what kind of info it needs, and what it 	will give back. and UDDI keeps a list of available web services and how to find them.
